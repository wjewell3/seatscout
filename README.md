# 🎯 SeatScout - HubSpot Seat Optimizer

> **Stop paying for seats you don't need.**

HubSpot shows you who's inactive. SeatScout shows you where you're overpaying.

---

## 💰 The Problem

Most companies waste **20-40% of their HubSpot budget** on unused seats:

- ❌ Deactivated users who still have paid seats assigned (HubSpot doesn't auto-remove them)
- ❌ Users who login but don't actually *work* in HubSpot
- ❌ Users with expensive Sales Hub seats who never use sales features
- ❌ Old employees who left months ago but still occupy licenses

**HubSpot's native tools don't show you this.** They show last login date, but not actual usage.

---

## ✨ What SeatScout Does

SeatScout audits your HubSpot account and finds:

1. **Deactivated users with paid seats** (100% confidence)
2. **Users with no login activity** in 90+ days (Enterprise only, 95% confidence)
3. **Users with no real work** - no calls, meetings, tasks, CRM updates (80% confidence)
4. **Estimated dollar savings** - monthly and annual waste

### Example Output

```
🚨 HIGH CONFIDENCE - REMOVE IMMEDIATELY (3 users, $150/mo)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. John Doe (john@company.com)
   Account deactivated - check if seat still assigned
   Confidence: 100% | Monthly cost: $50

2. Jane Smith (jane@company.com)
   No login in 120 days, no engagements detected
   Confidence: 95% | Monthly cost: $50

⚠️  MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE (2 users, $100/mo)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Old Employee (old@company.com)
   No engagements in 60+ days, no CRM activity in 30+ days
   Confidence: 80% | Monthly cost: $50

SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Estimated monthly waste: $250
Estimated annual waste: $3,000
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No engagements attributed"

**Cause:** Engagements don't have owners assigned

**Fix:** In HubSpot:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Properties** → **Contact properties**
2. Find "HubSpot Owner" and set a default value
3. Train users to assign owners when logging calls/meetings

### "Enterprise login API not available"

**Normal for Pro/Standard accounts.** You'll get 70-80% accuracy instead of 95%.

To upgrade accuracy: Contact HubSpot to upgrade to Enterprise tier.

### "API rate limit exceeded"

**Cause:** Too many API calls in a short time

**Fix:** Wait 10 minutes and run again. For large accounts (500+ users), contact us about the Enterprise version.

---

## 💡 Next Steps After Running

1. **Review the CSV** - Share with your finance team
2. **Cross-check in HubSpot** - Go to Settings → Users & Teams → Seats
3. **For deactivated users**: 
   - Reactivate the user
   - Unassign their seat
   - Deactivate again
4. **For inactive users**: Contact them to verify they still need access
5. **Set calendar reminder** to run quarterly
